MongoDB
To get MongoDB for your project, you can use our dedicated MongoDB image built on top of gitpod/workspace-base.

Simply base your .gitpod.dockerfile on:

language icon
dockerfile

FROM gitpod/workspace-mongodb

Then start the MongoDB server by running this in a Terminal or in a .gitpod.yml command:

language icon
bash

mkdir -p /workspace/data && mongod --dbpath /workspace/data
Note: Storing MongoDBâ€™s data inside /workspace ensures that it will get backed up and restored properly when you stop and restart a workspace, or share a snapshot.
